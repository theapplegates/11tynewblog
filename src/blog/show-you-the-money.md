I'm going to bitch about bad waitstaff. Common sense does not prevail in this story.
The wife and I were out eating and a nice older man took our order. He was friendly and funny, and I thought he would be a good waiter. I was wrong. First, it took forever to get our drinks. Then when our meal came he did not bring extra sauce for my chicken tenders like I asked, nor did he bring drink refills after I saw him look over as he was taking another table's order. 
Now we come to my logical way of being a waiter or waitress. When someone asks for extra sauce, or to leave and ingredient off an order and we see you write it down this is how it should happen. Somehow the cook indicates your food is ready to take to the table. You get out your ordering pad and look to see if the food matches the tomato I asked to be removed or that extra sauce I wanted. How hard is this to do? Apparently very hard. Oh and here's another tip, when you bring the food automatically bring refills. That way I don't have to ask and waste another twenty minutes of my life.
There enough bitching for now.
